1. `git init`

- I want to track my local directory.

2. `git add .`

- this command adds the file into staging area.
- git is file-based, thus empty folder won't be tracked.
- ` .` referring to current folder, this command add the whole folder to the staging area.

3. commit as atomic as possible, but also putting the change logically together
